# BF-ASM
Assembly-like language that is assembled to brain*ck.

## What is it?
BF-ASM will be easy to use. It will be very close to brainf*ck code, but it will have some high-level stuff.

## How can I use it?
Right now BF-ASM is not usable and __WIP__. 
Feel free to look around the code and contribute any changes.
